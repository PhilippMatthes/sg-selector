## ðŸ“š Introduction

![Filtering image](images/filtering.drawio.svg)

With the signal group (sg) selector library, it is possible to match traffic lights to routes. This is done by matching linestring geometries (MAP topologies) of traffic lights to the route geometry. Currently, this matching is achieved using above filtering pipeline. This filtering pipeline consists of four fixed-order steps.

1. [Proximity matching](backend/backend/routing/matching/proximity.py) â€“ Exclude all signal groups that are too far away from the route.
2. [Bearing matching](backend/backend/routing/matching/bearing.py) - Exclude all signal groups that have too much angle difference with regards to the route.
3. [Length matching](backend/backend/routing/matching/length.py) - Exclude all signal groups which can not be projected onto the route without a too big length difference.
4. [Overlap matching](backend/backend/routing/matching/overlap.py) - Under the remaining signal groups, find overlaps and decide for the better matches.

This filtering pipeline is defined as a [hypermodel](backend/backend/routing/matching/hypermodel.py) and tuned by Optuna on a training dataset. The best [configuration](backend/backend/config/topologic.hypermodel.json) is available with a RESTful API.

## ðŸ”§ Quickstart

### 1. Build and run the development setup

Run the development setup with

```bash
docker-compose up
```

On the very first startup, this will download the base Docker images and build the containers (can take some time). 

### 2. Load the example signal groups into the database

We provide an example JSON which you can load into the database. This JSON is inherited from the Urban Data Platform Hamburg, which uses a [FROST](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server) API.
However, the service is not limited to this specific data format. See [backend/routing/models.py](backend/routing/models.py) for the basic model structure.

```bash
docker exec -t -i sg-selector-backend poetry run python backend/manage.py load_sgs /examples/sgs_hamburg.json
```

### 3. Send a request to the REST Endpoint at *POST* `/routing/select`

#### Request format

Select signal groups along a given route. The body of the POST request should contain a route as follows:

```
{
    "route": [
        { "lon": <longitude>, "lat": <latitude>, "alt": <altitude> },
        ...
    ]
}
```

#### Response format

Perform an example request with the example preset route:

```bash
curl --data "@examples/route_hamburg.json" http://localhost:8000/routing/select
```

Results are in the following structure:

```
{
  "waypoints": [
    {
      "lon": 9.990909,
      "lat": 53.560863,
      "alt": 9.99,
      "distanceToNextSignal": 152.0200566720922,
      "nextSignal": "1814"
    },
    ... [ Truncated ]
    {
      "lon": 9.978001,
      "lat": 53.564378,
      "alt": 20.22,
      "distanceToNextSignal": null,
      "nextSignal": null
    }
  ],
  "signals": [
    {
      "id": "1814",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "LineString",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            9.9901167,
            53.5614852
          ],
          [
            9.9900136,
            53.5615304
          ]
        ]
      }
    },
    ... [ Truncated ]
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing

This library is available under MIT License. Contributions are welcome. Here are our current TODOs:

- [x] Publish usable library with our topologic feature matching pipeline
- [ ] Incorporate Python scripts for random route generation
- [ ] Polish and push management commands for hypermodel training and testing
- [ ] Add Route Composer web application which is used for training dataset generation
- [ ] Include experimental matching approaches (H3-Cells, ML-Model, ...)
- [ ] ...

## ðŸ’¥ Troubleshooting

You may have to make the entrypoint scripts executable with `chmod +x path/to/entrypoint.sh`.
